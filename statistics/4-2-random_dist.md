[Think Stats Chapter 4 Exercise 2](http://greenteapress.com/thinkstats2/html/thinkstats2005.html#toc41) (a random distribution)

>> **1. The problem**  
>>    The numbers generated by `random.random` are supposed to be uniform between 0 and 1; that is, every value in the range should have the same probability. Generate 1000 numbers from random.random and plot their PMF and CDF. Is the distribution uniform?  
>>
>> **2. How I solved it**  
>>    I generated 1000 random numbers using the random() function in numpy. I used the texbook-supplied Pmf and Cdf classes to make the pmf and cdf of the random numbers sample, and plotted them. 
>>
>>
>> **3. The solution:**  
>>    ipython code:
>>    ```
>>    # Generate 1000 numbers from random.random
>>    random_nums = np.random.random(1000)
>>
>>    # Compute and plot a pmf for the random numbers sample
>>    pmf = thinkstats2.Pmf(random_nums)
>>    thinkplot.Pmf(pmf, linewidth=0.1)
>>    thinkplot.Config(xlabel='Random variate', ylabel='PMF')
>>    ```
>>    Result:  
>>    ![pmf of the random numbers distribution](https://github.com/33eyes/dsp/blob/master/statistics/metis_prework_stats_ex3_img1.png "pmf of the random numbers distribution")
>>
>>    ```
>>    # Compute and plot a cdf for the random numbers sample
>>    cdf = thinkstats2.Cdf(t)
>>    thinkplot.Cdf(cdf)
>>    thinkplot.Config(xlabel='Random variate', ylabel='CDF')
>>    ```
>>    Result:  
>>    ![cdf of the random numbers distribution](https://github.com/33eyes/dsp/blob/master/statistics/metis_prework_stats_ex3_img2.png "cdf of the random numbers distribution")
>>
>>    Yes, the distribution is uniform. Both the pmf and the cdf show that the randomly generated 1000 numbers above are univormly distributed. The pmf is not easy to read for this, and without prior knowledge it might be hard to tell. The cdf clearly shows a straight 45-deg line, which indicates a uniform distribution, and it is much easier to read.
